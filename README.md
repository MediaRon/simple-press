# Simple:Press
Simple:Press is one of the most full featured forum plugins for WordPress. It was initially released when WordPress was just 3 years and and has been under continuous development since then for over 12 years!

## Requirements

- WordPress 4.9+
- PHP 5.6+

## Installation

To get started right away, just download the fully built plugin from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simplepress)

For development, you can just edit the files directly.  
There is no extensive or complicated build process required.  However, you do have to minify the JS and CSS files when not running in debug mode but that's it!

### Dependencies
