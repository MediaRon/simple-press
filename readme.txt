= Setup =

Whatever the method you used, after you activated the plugin through the plugins dashboard, you now need to run through a set-up process.  This creates the tables and default data that the plugin requires.
You can access this setup process by either clicking the INSTALL button that should be visible at the top of the admin pages or by going to FORUM->INSTALL.

At the conclusion of a successful install, a button will be displayed to load the forum admin and clicking on this will take you to the Storage Locations panel. All being well, all locations will be ticked as created and available but if this is not the case follow the instructions to manually create folders if necessary.

Now that you have installed your forums read our [getting started](https://simple-press.com/documentation/codex/getting-started/) pages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I've installed the plugin - now what? =

Now that you have installed your forums read our [getting started](https://simple-press.com/documentation/codex/getting-started/) pages.

= I don't receive e-mail notifications =

There are several factors that can influence e-mail notifications delivery. The best thing you can do to diagnose email delivery issues is to install a plugin that shows you an email log.  We recommend MAILGUN or SMTP POST.  The logs will let you know if emails are being generated and not delivered or just not being generated at all.
